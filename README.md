Working on a port of senSAE(http://www.sensae.us/) to Electron in order to use web technologies to create visualizers.

You must have NodeJS(https://nodejs.org/en/) in order to install and build Electron's dependencies. Once you do:

npm install 
npm start

Current status:
Three basic themes:
CircleGridTheme
FreqBarTheme
ShapePopTheme
